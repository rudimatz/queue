# RFC Editor Queue

As streams approve documents for publication, they enter the [publication queue](https://queue.rfc-editor.org), which provides information about documents as they progress through the [RFC editorial process](https://authors.ietf.org/en/rfc-publication-process). The queue is also available as an [XML file](/api/v1/queue.xml).

## Status

* **In Progress**: The document is either being worked on by the RFC Production Center (RPC) or is waiting to be worked on by the RPC. 
  - **Awaiting [Assignment]**: The document is waiting to be assigned to an editor for formatting, reference checking, first edit, or second edit.
  - **In Progress (Formatting)**: The document formatting (e.g., lists, tables, artwork) is being updated. See [RFCXML editing](https://authors.ietf.org/en/rfc-publication-process#rfcxml-editing) for details.
  - **In Progress (Reference Checker)**: The references are being checked for accuracy and stability.
  - **In Progress (First Editor)**: The document is being copyedited.
  - **In Progress (Second Editor)**: The document is getting a second review with a focus on any complex issues, source code, or text regarding IANA actions.
  - **In Final Review**: Awaiting final approval(s) from authors and/or action holders; click "more details" to see the Final Review status.

* **Blocked**: The document is not moving forward. This can be for various reasons.
   - **Author Input Required**: The RPC is awaiting a reply from the author.
   - **Waiting for Action Holder**: The RPC is awaiting a reply from an action holder (for example, an Area Director).
   - **Reference Not Received**: The document has a normative reference to an Internet-Draft that is not yet in the queue.
   - **Reference Not Received (2nd Generation)**: The document has a normative reference to a document that normatively references an Internet-Draft that is not yet in the queue.
   - **Reference Not Received (3rd Generation)**: The document has a normative reference to a document that normatively references a document that normatively references an Internet-Draft that is not yet in the queue.
   - **Reference First Edit Incomplete**: The document has a normative reference to a document that is still in First Edit.
   - **Reference Second Edit Incomplete**: The document has a normative reference to a document that is still in Second Edit.
   - **IANA Hold**: The document has been edited and is awaiting completion of IANA actions. See [IANA's status page](https://www.iana.org/performance/ietf-draft-status).
   - **Stream Hold**: The document is being held per the request of the publication stream that approved it. See details on streams on [What is an RFC?](https://www.rfc-editor.org/series/rfc/).
   - **Tools Issue**: The document is waiting for a fix to an editing or publishing tool.
  
## Labels

- **GitHub**: GitHub will be used for Final Review, per the authors' request. (See details on [GitHub Pilot](https://rpc-wiki.rfc-editor.org/doku.php?id=rpc-github-phase-0-pilot-test)).
- **Markdown**: The author-provided markdown file is being edited, per the authors' request. (See details on [kramdown-rfc Pilot](https://rpc-wiki.rfc-editor.org/doku.php?id=pilot_test_kramdown_rfc)).
- **Expedited**: The processing of this document is being expedited per the request of the publication stream.
- **Code**: These labels indicate that the document contains source code such as YANG, XML, ABNF, or MIB.
- **Bis**: A bis document will replace a published RFC.
- **Status Change**: This document is changing the Status of another RFC (e.g., moving the other RFC to Historic).

Other labels may be used with documents to indicate the editing work level (e.g., **Formatting: Hard**).

## More Details on Final Review

During the [Final Review process](https://authors.ietf.org/en/rfc-publication-process#authors-final-review) for a given document, the edited document is reviewed by the authors before publication. The status of approvals from each author and any action holders are listed on the Final Review page. All emails regarding Final Review are in the [mail archive](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/auth48archive/).
